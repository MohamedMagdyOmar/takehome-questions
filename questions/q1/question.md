## Question 1

Given a string S and a list of allowed words D, find the least number of spaces to split S into words all from D. If splitting is not possible, print 'n/a.'

### Examples

-   `S: “abc”, D: [“ab”,”bc”] -> n/a`
-   `S: “cdab”, D: [“ab”, “cd”] -> 1, “cd ab”`
-   `S: “abcdefab”, D:[“abc”, “def”,”ab”,”cd”,”ef”] -> 2, “abc def ab”`
