Take-home questions for RL research developers

Welcome to RL research and thank you for interested in coming to work with us. Below you'll find three questions, you can choose one between q2 and q3. This whole exercise might take up to seven hours to complete.

You might choose to use Python/JavaScript or C# to write your answer, though Python is preferred. You are encouraged to write comments and remarks for your code or unit tests for it.

Please fork this repo and once you are done, you can either submit a pull request or send your repo link to us.

If you have any questions, please contact us. jzhou@rlsolutions.com

Thank you and good luck!
